<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
<section id= "poem1">
<p id="para1">'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<ul>
  <li>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</li>
  <li>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</li>
  <li>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</li>
  <li>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</li>
</ul>

<p id="para2">Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.</p>

<p id="para3">And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</p>

<p id="para4">One two! One two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.</p>

<p id="para5">'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.</p>

<p id="para6">'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>

<h2>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h2>
<section id="poem2">
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The <strong>billows smooth and bright</strong> --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.

<h3>The <em>moon</em> was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'</h3>

<h4>The sea was wet as wet could be,
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.</h4>

<h5>The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'</h5>

<h6>'If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.</h6>

<p id="para7">'O Oysters, come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'</p>

<div id="div1">The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.</div>

<p id="para8">Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.</p>

<p id="para9">Four other Oysters followed them,
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.</p>

<p id="para10">The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.</p>

<p id="para11">'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'</p>

<ol>
  <li>'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,</li>
  <li>'Before we have our chat;</li>
  <li>For some of us are out of breath,</li>
  <li>And all of us are fat!'</li>
  <li>'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.</li>
  <li>They thanked him much for that.</li>
</ol>

<p id="para12">'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'</p>

<p id="para13">'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'</p>

<p id="para14">'It was so kind of you to come!
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'</p>

<p id="para15">'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'</p>

<p id="para16">'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.</p>

<footer>O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.</footer>
